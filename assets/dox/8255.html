<ul>
<li>If a port is defined as input, then it's output's will be at high impedance.
A device connected to a port of the 8255 will see &amp;FF on the port outputs.
</ul>
<p>This can be tested with the following code:

<p>


<p>The 8255 is a general purpose  input/output  IC. This document will
describe it's role in the Amstrad CPC,CPC+ and KC compact systems. To
understand it's full functions please read the datasheet.

<p>In these systems it is connected to the AY-3-8912 Programmable Sound Generator (PSG),
keyboard, cassette recorder, the VSYNC of the 6845 CRTC and the &quot;busy&quot; signal
from the parallel port.

<p>The PPI is selected when bit 11 of the I/O port address is set to &quot;0&quot;,
bits 9 and 8 then define the PPI function access as shown below:

<p>It is advised that the remaining bits of the I/O address are set to &quot;1&quot; 
to avoid conflict with other devices. The recommended I/O addressess are:

<p>In the CPC+, the 8255 is integrated into the ASIC. The &quot;emulation&quot; is not complete and
some functionality is not available. Please see the &quot;Extra CPC+ documentation&quot;
for more information.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Mode 1 (Strobed Input/Output) and Mode 2 (Bi-Directional Bus), as far as I know,
are not used by any program, Mode 0 (Basic Input/Output) is always used.
</ul>

<h2>Port Usage</h2>

<p>NOTE:
<ul>
<li>If you are using the firmware, always return the operating modes
and I/O state of the ports used  to their settings below. The firmware  expects  the  settings
to be the same as given below and may operate incorrectly if they are not.

<li>On the CPC464,CPC664,CPC6128,CPC464+,CPC6128+ and GX4000 bits 3,2 and 1 define the manufacturer name.
See below to see the options available. The manufacturer name is defined on the PCB and cannot be changed
through software.
<li>On the CPC464,CPC664,CPC6128,CPC464+,CPC6128+ and GX4000 bit 4 defines the Screen refresh frequency.

On the KC compact bit 4 is &quot;1&quot;
<li>This bit is connected to /EXP signal on the expansion port.
<ul>
<li>On the KC Compact this bit is used to define bit 7 of the printer data.
<li>On the CPC, it is possible to use this bit to define bit 7 of the printer data, so a 8-bit printer
port is made, with a hardware modification,
<li>On the CPC this can be used by a expansion device to report it's presence.
&quot;1&quot; = device connected, &quot;0&quot; = device not connected.
This is not always used by all expansion devices.
