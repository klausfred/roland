<h1>The 6845 Cathode Ray Tube Controller (CRTC)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The 6845 Cathode Ray Tube Controller (CRTC) is a programmable IC used to generate video displays. This IC
is used in a variety of computers including the Amstrad CPC, Amstrad CPC+ and KC Compact.

<h2>CRTC in the Amstrad CPC/CPC+ and KC Compact designs</h2>
  
<p>The CRTC was a common part available from many different manufacturers. 
During the life of the CPC, Amstrad sourced the CRTC from various manufacturers.

<p>All ICs used were based on the same design but have a different implementation. As a result they do not 
operate identically in all situations. This document highlights these differences.

<p>This table lists the known ICs used, with their part number, manufacturer and type number.

<p>NOTES:
<ol>
<li>The CRTC functionality is integrated into the CPC+ ASIC. This type exists only in
the CPC464+,CPC6128+ and GX4000.
<li>As far as I know, this type exists only in &quot;cost-down&quot; CPC6128 systems.
In the &quot;cost-down&quot; CPC6128, the CRTC functionality is integrated into a single ASIC IC.
This ASIC is often refered to as the &quot;Pre-ASIC&quot; because it preceeded the CPC+ ASIC.
<li>
<p>In the Amstrad community each 6845 implementation has been assigned a type number. This type
identifies a group of implementations which operate in exactly the same way.

<p>As far as I know, the type number system was originally used by demo programmers.

<p>It is possible to detect the 6845 present using software methods, and this is done to:
<ul>
<li>warn that the software was not designed for the detected 6845 and may function incorrectly,
<li>to adapt the software so that it will run with the detected 6845
</ul>
<p>In most cases, the type of the detected 6845 is reported. 
</li>
<li>As far as I know, the KC compact used HD6845S only.
</ol>

<p>The 6845 is selected when bit 14 of the I/O port address is set to &quot;0&quot;. 
Bit 1 and 0 of the I/O port address define the function to access. The remaining bits
can be any value, but it is adviseable to set these to &quot;1&quot; to avoid conflict
with other devices in the system.

<p>The recommended I/O port addressess are:

<dd>DISPTMG signal defines the border. When DISPTMG is &quot;1&quot; the border colour is output to the display.</dd>
<dt>HSYNC and VSYNC</dt>
<dd>HSYNC and VSYNC from the CRTC are passed into the Gate-Array. The Gate-Array modifies the signals and then mixes these to form the Composite-Sync which is output to the display</dd>
